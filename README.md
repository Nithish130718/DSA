## Python Codes for Data Structures and Algorithms

### Ex-1:
- **Arithmetic.py**: Provides functions to check if input integer values can satisfy given arithmetic formulas.
- **ChangeMakingProblem.py**: Determines the minimum number of currency notes (or coins) needed to make a given amount of change optimally.
- **EuclideanForm.py**: Finds the P-norm form or the Euclidean form of a vector based on the power of the sequence.
- **MinMax.py**: Finds the minmax of a list consisting of elements of the same data type.
- **OddDistinctPairs.py**: Finds the odd distinct pairs of a list.
- **Shuffle.py**: Shuffles a list without using any built-in functions based on an algorithm.

### Ex-2:
- **Circle.py**: A class to find the area and perimeter of a circle.
- **PointClass.py**: Defines a Point class to find the Euclidean distance between two points created as objects of the class.
- **Rational.py**: Checks if two numbers form a valid rational number and provides methods to perform arithmetic operations on rational numbers.
- **Spl_methods.py**: Classes with functions to add and subtract two sets of point coordinates.

### Ex-3:
- **Matrix.py**: A class 'Matrices' to perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two matrices.
- **Vector_partA.py**: A class 'Point' to find the Euclidean distance between two points created as objects of the class. Methods for vector operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication (dot product), and checking equality of vector size.
- **Vector_partB.py**: Similar to Vector_partA.py but the vector itself is passed as an argument.

### Ex-4:
- **Horner's Method.py**: Implements Horner's method for solving polynomials of nth degree with O(n) time complexity.
- **PolyEval.py**: Evaluates polynomials of nth degree with O(nlogn) time complexity.
- **Polynomial_Bruteforce.py**: Evaluates polynomials of nth degree with O(n^2) time complexity.

### Sorting Algorithms:
- **BubbleSort.py**: Implements bubble sort algorithm and its complexity.
- **InsertionSort.py**: Implements insertion sort algorithm and its complexity.
- **MergeSort.py**: Implements merge sort algorithm and its complexity.
- **QuickSort.py**: Implements quick sort algorithm and its complexity.
- **SelectionSort.py**: Implements selection sort algorithm and its complexity.

### DynamicArrays.py:
- Implementation of dynamic arrays.
